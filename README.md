# Facebook App Scroll Event

## What does it do?

In a Facebook App, there is no "scroll" event (assuming you have the scrollbars hidden on your app, as most apps do), so using this script allows you to subscribe to a custom Facebook event "scroll" or listen to the custom event "fb-scroll" and change the UI or trigger events based on the users current scroll position in your app.

## Updated to work outside of Facebook

Now updated to support Facebook Mobile Apps ie: apps that are outside of Facebook and FB.Canvas.getPageInfo is not available. Please note, you must have scrollbars on for this to work!

## Dependencies

Facebook Javascript SDK

## Installation

Include this javascript file directly after your window.fbAsyncInit function and before you include the Facebook Javascript SDK.

```html
	<div id="fb-root"></div>
	<script>
		window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
			// init the FB JS SDK
			FB.init({
				appId      : 'YOUR_APP_ID',                        // App ID from the app dashboard
				channelUrl : '//WWW.YOUR_DOMAIN.COM/channel.html', // Channel file for x-domain comms
				status     : true,                                 // Check Facebook Login status
				xfbml      : true                                  // Look for social plugins on the page
			});

			// Additional initialization code such as adding Event Listeners goes here
		};
	</script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/fb-scroll.js"></script>
	<script>
		// Load the SDK asynchronously
		(function(d, s, id){
			var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
			if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}
			js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
			js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js";
			fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
		}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));
	</script>
```

# Usage

You can subscribe to a custom Facebook event "scroll" or listen to the dom event "fb-scroll" which passes an object that contains scroll parameters.

## Parameters

- **pageHeight** *integer* (0 - 100) - Height of your app in pixels.
- **viewportHeight** *integer* (0 - 100) - The height of your app visible in the viewport (removes floating Facebook header and static header from reported viewport height).
- **viewportTop** *integer* (0 - 100) - How many pixels down the page the top of the viewport is. Example: When the user is scrolled to the top of the page it will be 0.
- **viewportMiddle** *integer* (0 - 100) - How many pixels down the page the middle of the viewport is.
- **viewportBottom** *integer* (0 - 100) - How many pixels down the page the bottom of the viewport is.
- **viewportTopPercent** *integer* (0 - 100) - Percentage of how far down the top of the viewport is on the page. Example: When the user is scrolled to the top of the page it will be 0.
- **viewportMiddlePercent** *integer* (0 - 100) - Percentage of how far down the middle of the viewport is on the page. Example: When the user is scrolled to the middle of the page it will be 50.
- **viewportBottomPercent** *integer* (0 - 100) - Percentage of how far down the bottom of the viewport is on the page. Example: When the user is scrolled to the bottom of the page it will be 100.

## Facebook Javascript SDK subscribing to custom event

Warning: this causes the following message to appear in the console "The method FB.Event.fire is not officially supported by Facebook and access to it will soon be removed."

```javascript
	FB.Event.subscribe('scroll', function(info){
		console.log('scroll', info);
	});
```

## jQuery

```javascript
	jQuery(document).on('fb-scroll', function(evt, info){
		console.log('scroll', info);
	});
```

## Real world example "Infinite Scroll"

```javascript
	jQuery(document).on('fb-scroll', function(evt, info){
		if(info.viewportBottomPercent == 100){
			// load more content
		}
	});
```
